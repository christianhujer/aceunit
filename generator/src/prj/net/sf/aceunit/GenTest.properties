helpHeader=Usage: java -jar  AceUnit.jar [OPTION]... [BASENAME]...\nCreate AceUnit unit test headers for one or more suites with the specified BASENAME(s) (omit .c suffix for fixtures).\n
helpFooter=Examples:\n  java -jar AceUnit.jar sortTest\n  java -jar AceUnit.jar --print=generated -o alltests.txt src/test/\n
setForce=Overwrite write-protected files.
setPrint=Specifies what to print. Comma separated enum set.\n                        suites: Print suite file names.\n                        fixtures: Print fixture file names.\n                        generated: Generated file names.\n                        headers: Header file names.\n                        sources: Source file names.
setAllTestsFilename=Write a table of all tests and their ids to the specified file.
disableGenSuites=Disables the generation of Suite*.c files.\n                        If Suite*.c files are not generated, ACEUNIT_SUITES cannot be used.\n                        The default is that Suite*.c files are generated.
setFileSortingLocale=Specifies the locale to use for file sorting. This enables a reproducible order of tests in environments with exotic file ordering (i.e. ClearCase dynamic views) or mixed locale.\n                        Use the empty String ("") to use no locale (default).\n                        Use a dot (".") to use the user's locale.
