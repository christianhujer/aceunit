# AceUnit-3

Welcome to AceUnit, the Advanced C and Embedded Unit test framework.
AceUnit is a comfortable (test discovery!) unit test framework for C, in the best tradition of xUnit frameworks (like JUnit).
Its target audience are developers using the C programming language to develop firmware, drivers, operating systems, and other C programs, like command line programs.
It is tiny and thus suitable even for extremely resource-constraint environments.

AceUnit can also be used to study or teach Test-Driven Development.
Although, you don't really need a framework for that in C, did you know that?
A framework just helps making your life more comfortable.

The purpose of AceUnit is to be portable, small, and usable in resource-constraint environments as well as on PCs.

This is the third version of AceUnit, and a complete rewrite from scratch.
The "template" for this version of AceUnit is no longer JUnit 4 but JUnit 5.

```C
#include "leapyear.h"
#include <assert.h>

void testLeapYears(void) {
    assert(isLeapYear(0));
    assert(isLeapYear(4));
    assert(isLeapYear(400));
}

void testNonLeapYears(void) {
    assert(!isLeapYear(1));
    assert(!isLeapYear(100));
}
```

## Attributes and Design Goals
* JUnit 5.x-style naming.
* Consumes only very little resources.
* Works for hosted, freestanding,  and even exotic freestanding environments.
* Supports C89/C90, C99, C11, C17, and C23.
* Configurable.
* Can be run with pure C89/C90 and thus can be used in environments for which C++ is not available or used (i.e. 80x51).
* Minimal framework noise in the test code.
  Especially, no macro noise and no fixture management noise.
* Make use of existing C features from the hosted environment and POSIX, but _without requiring_ a hosted environment or POSIX.
  It will also work just fine on the freestanding environment of an embedded controller.

## Compilers

This new version of AceUnit has been tested extensively using the following compilers:
* GCC 11 w/ the following settings on `x86_64`: c90 c99 c11 c17 c2x gnu90 gnu99 gnu11 gnu17 gnu2x

## How to Build
To build AceUnit, you need a GNU `bash` shell, GNU `make`, and a C compiler with `objdump`, `readelf`, or `nm`.
To build it, simply run `make`.
This builds and tests AceUnit.

## How to Install
If you want to use AceUnit for testing on your POSIX system, simply run `make && sudo make install`.
This will install AceUnit into `/usr/local/`.
You can override the installation location using the `PREFIX` variable, like this: `sudo make install PREFIX=/opt/aceunit/`.
The `PREFIX` variable only has an effect during installation, you do not need to rebuild.

The same way, you can remove a previous installation by running `sudo make uninstall`.

### How to build with a different compiler.
By default, AceUnit will be built with/for the C compiler that your `make` tool uses, usually whatever `cc` is found on the `PATH`.
If you want to build and test with a different compiler, you can use `make CC=compilername`, for example, `make CC=clang` or `make CC=armcc`.

You can also easily cross-compile for multiple targets in parallel.
The `Makefile` in `aceunit/lib` can be used from other directories.
See `test/cross/` for examples of how that works.

## Runners
AceUnit provides different runners for different needs.
Out of the box, AceUnit comes with 4 runners: Simple, SetJmp, Abort, and Fork.
AceUnit is well-documented, it should be easy to create your own runner if necessary.

### SimpleRunner
The SimpleRunner just executes the tests without any special handling.
If a test case fails, the runner stops.

The SimpleRunner is good to get started and for learning and practicing TDD.

For real-life projects, the SimpleRunner is less suited.
As it will stop at the first error, there will be no information about the total number of test cases and errors.
But do not fret, there are other runners.

### SetJmpRunner
The SetJmpRunner uses `setjmp()` / `longjmp()` to intercept failed assertion.
The `assert()` macro is defined to call `AceUnit_fail()` when the condition fails.
And `AceUnit_fail()` performs a `longjmp()` back.

This runner works in freestanding environments _as long as `setjmp()`/`longjmp()` are available_.
According to the C standard, freestanding environments are not required to provide `<setjmp.h>`.
However, most freestanding environments do so.

### AbortRunner
The AbortRunner is like the SetJmpRunner and additionally has a signal handler to catch the `abort()` signal.
If a test case fails by raising `SIGABRT`, the runner will catch it.

### ForkRunner
The ForkRunner uses `fork()` to execute test cases in child processes.
A test case is marked failed if the child ended due to a signal, or if it exited with an exit value other than `EXIT_SUCCESS` (0).

### Writing your own Runner
If the runners provided out of the box do not suit you, you can simply write your own.
Just look at the source code of the existing runners to get inspired.
They're simple and should be easy to understand.

## Workflow
1. Build AceUnit. Skip this step if you've installed AceUnit in your system and you're testing for the same system.
2. Build your object files as usual.
3. Build your test object files (can be included in the previous step).
4. Run `aceunit` on the test object files to generate the fixtures source code.
5. Build your fixtures object file.
6. Build a test executable linking the object files together with the aceunit library of your choice.
7. Run the tests.

Here's an example of how such a Workflow could look like on the command-line:
```bash
# Build AceUnit
$ cd aceunit
$ make
# Build your object files and test object files
$ cd ../myproject
$ cc -I ../aceunit/include/ -c *.c
# Run aceunit on the test object files to generate the fixtures source code.
$ ../aceunit/bin/aceunit *_test.o >testcases.c
# Build your fixtures object file.
$ cc -I ../aceunit/include/ -c testcases.c
# Build a test executable linking the object files together with the aceunit library of your choice.
$ cc *.o ../aceunit/lib/libaceunit-abort.a
# Run the tests
$ ./a.out
AceUnit: 2 test cases, 2 successful, 0 failed.
```

Here's an example of a `Makefile` that implements such a workflow:
```Makefile
ACEUNIT_HOME=../aceunit
ACEUNIT_LIBRARY=$(ACEUNIT_HOME)/lib/libaceunit-abort.a
CPPFLAGS+=-I $(ACEUNIT_HOME)/include

.PHONY: all
all: test

.PHONY: test
test: leapyear_test
	./$^

leapyear_test: leapyear_test.o leapyear.o testcases.o $(ACEUNIT_LIBRARY)

$(ACEUNIT_LIBRARY):
	$(MAKE) -C $(dir $(ACEUNIT_LIBRARY))

testcases.c: leapyear_test.o
	$(ACEUNIT_HOME)/bin/aceunit $^ >$@

.PHONY: clean
clean::
	$(RM) *.[adios] *.bc leapyear_test testcases.c
```

## Assertion/Failure Features
There are multiple ways how you can make a test-case fail.

<table>
<tr><th>Assertion</th>                              <th>SimpleRunner</th><th>SetJmpRunner</th><th>AbortRunner</th><th>ForkRunner</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt; longjmp()</code></td><td>no</td>          <td>yes</td>         <td>yes</td>        <td>no (not required)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&lt;assert.h&gt; assert()</code></td> <td>stop</td>        <td>no</td>          <td>yes</td>        <td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt; abort()</code></td>  <td>stop</td>        <td>no</td>          <td>yes</td>        <td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt; exit()</code></td>   <td>stop</td>        <td>no</td>          <td>no</td>         <td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&lt;AceUnit.h&gt; assert()</code></td><td>stop</td>        <td>yes</td>         <td>yes</td>        <td>yes</td></tr>
</table>

## Test Fixtures

## What is different from previous versions?
The whole code has been rewritten from scratch, test-driven and with ease-of-use on mind.
The nomenclature has been updated to match that of JUnit5.
The generator has been changed from a Java program to a shell script.
Also, the generator no loner works on the source file, which is fragile.
Instead, the generator uses tools like `objdump`, `nm`, or `readelf` to extract the symbol table and thus introspect the code to discover fixtures and test cases.

## Dropped Features
The previous versions of AceUnit had a number of features that have been deliberately dropped to keep things simple:
<dl>
<dt>Annotation-style processing</dt><dd>Previous versions of AceUnit used annootation-style processing like `A_Test`, `A_BeforeClass`, and so on. This was a bit fragile and required an extra parser. Annotations will come back once C has annotations. They're on the way, give it a few more years. This also made it possible to get rid of _Java_ for the generator and replace it with a simple shell script.</dd>
<dt>Multiple fixture methods</dt><dd>Previous versions of AceUnit allowed for multiple setup and teardown functions per fixture. I don't think this was really used. This has been dropped to save a bit of memory.</dd>
</dl>
